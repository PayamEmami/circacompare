# Installation

If you have not done so already, install `devtools` using the following code:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install circacompare directly using the following code:
```
devtools::install_github("RWParsons/circacompare")
```
# Help

Once loaded into R, load the documentation using `?circacompare`.  As per the example, you can use the other function, `make_data`, to generate example data appropriate for use in the `circacompare` function.
